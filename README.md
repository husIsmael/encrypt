# Encrypted Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Encrypted Project! This project leverages chaotic maps as key generators to provide robust encryption solutions. Chaotic maps, known for their sensitivity to initial conditions and complex behavior, offer a high level of security for cryptographic applications. By integrating these mathematical constructs, our project ensures that encryption keys are both unpredictable and secure, making it an ideal choice for protecting sensitive data.
